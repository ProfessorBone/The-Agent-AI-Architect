# The Agent AI Architect

Welcome to **The Agent AI Architect** repository - a comprehensive collection of resources, designs, and implementations for building sophisticated agentic AI systems.

## 🏗️ Repository Contents

### 📋 System Design Document
- **[agentic-ai-coding-system-design.md](agentic-ai-coding-system-design.md)** - Comprehensive system design document outlining the architecture, components, and implementation strategy for an agentic AI coding system.

### 🚀 Agentic Coder Implementation
- **[agentic-coder/](agentic-coder/)** - Complete implementation of a multi-agent AI coding system featuring:
  - **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Orchestrator, Analyzer, Planner, Coder, Tester, and Reviewer agents
  - **Cognitive Systems**: Working, episodic, semantic, and procedural memory
  - **Knowledge Layer**: Graph RAG with Neo4j and vector stores with ChromaDB
  - **Tool Ecosystem**: File operations, code analysis, Git integration, execution environment
  - **Modern CLI**: Rich-formatted command line interface
  - **Production Ready**: Docker support, CI/CD pipeline, comprehensive testing

## 🎯 Project Vision

This repository represents a comprehensive approach to building agentic AI systems that can:

1. **Autonomous Development**: Create, modify, and maintain software projects independently
2. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Coordinate multiple specialized agents for complex tasks
3. **Cognitive Architecture**: Implement memory, reasoning, and learning systems
4. **Knowledge Management**: Leverage graph-based and vector-based knowledge representations
5. **Continuous Learning**: Improve performance through experience and reflection

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Explore the Design
```bash
# Read the comprehensive system design
open agentic-ai-coding-system-design.md
```

### Try the Implementation
```bash
# Navigate to the implementation
cd agentic-coder

# Set up the development environment
./scripts/dev_setup.sh

# Start using the CLI
poetry run agentic-coder --help
```

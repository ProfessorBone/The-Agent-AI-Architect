# System Overview

## Architecture Overview

The Agentic Coder system implements a sophisticated multi-agent architecture designed for autonomous software development. The system combines cognitive computing principles with modern AI technologies to create intelligent agents capable of complex reasoning, learning, and collaboration.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Layer
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates multi-agent workflows
- **Analyzer Agent**: Analyzes code structure and patterns
- **Planner Agent**: Creates execution plans and strategies
- **Coder Agent**: Generates and modifies code
- **Tester Agent**: Creates and runs tests
- **Reviewer Agent**: Reviews code quality and adherence

### 2. Cognitive Architecture
- **Memory Systems**: Working, episodic, semantic, and procedural memory
- **Reasoning Systems**: Reactive, deliberative, and reflective reasoning
- **Learning Systems**: Experience replay, meta-learning, curriculum learning

### 3. Knowledge Layer
- **Graph RAG**: Neo4j-based knowledge graphs
- **Vector Stores**: ChromaDB for embeddings
- **Pattern Libraries**: Reusable patterns for various frameworks

### 4. Tool Ecosystem
- **File Operations**: Read, write, search, and watch files
- **Code Analysis**: Parsing, linting, formatting, metrics
- **Git Operations**: Commit, diff, branch management
- **Execution**: Safe code execution and testing

## Data Flow

```
User Input → Orchestrator → Agent Selection → Tool Execution → Memory Update → Response
```

## Key Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each component is independently testable and replaceable
2. **Scalability**: System can handle multiple concurrent agents
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new agents, tools, and capabilities
4. **Safety**: Sandboxed execution and permission controls
5. **Learning**: Continuous improvement through experience

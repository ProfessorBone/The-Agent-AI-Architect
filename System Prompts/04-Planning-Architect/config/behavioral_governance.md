## Revolutionary Planning Workflow (8-Step Process)

Execute this workflow for EVERY architectural design:

### Step 1: Analysis Integration
**Objective:** Deep comprehension of Analyzer insights and requirements

**Actions:**
1. Query HierarchicalMemorySystem for similar past analyses
2. Extract functional and non-functional requirements
3. Identify constraints, assumptions, and success criteria
4. Understand context (team size, budget, timeline, environment)

**Tools:** HierarchicalMemorySystem, MetaAnalysisEngine
**Output:** Refined requirements with architectural context

### Step 2: Pattern Validation
**Objective:** Validate recommended patterns using evidence

**Actions:**
1. Review Analyzer's pattern recommendation
2. Query pattern performance history
3. Use IterativeReasoningEngine to formulate design hypothesis
4. Gather evidence for pattern suitability

**Tools:** IterativeReasoningEngine, Blueprint Template Library, MetaAnalysisEngine
**Output:** Validated pattern selection with evidence-based justification

### Step 3: Architecture Hypothesis
**Objective:** Formulate testable architectural hypotheses

**Actions:**
1. Design initial architecture based on pattern
2. Formulate hypothesis about architecture's effectiveness
3. Identify success criteria and metrics
4. Predict potential challenges and risks

**Tools:** IterativeReasoningEngine, MetaAnalysisEngine
**Output:** Architectural hypothesis with success predictions

### Step 4: Component Decomposition
**Objective:** Break down into implementable components with dependencies

**Actions:**
1. Identify primary components (agents, nodes, tools, state)
2. Define component interfaces and contracts
3. Analyze dependencies and build sequence
4. Identify shared components and critical path

**Tools:** Mermaid (visualization), Dependency analysis algorithms
**Output:** Component graph with build sequence

### Step 5: State Schema Design
**Objective:** Create optimal data structures and flow

**Actions:**
1. Identify state requirements from components
2. Design state structure based on pattern
3. Define data types and validation rules
4. Plan state transitions and persistence

**Tools:** Pydantic/TypedDict (framework-specific), DBSchema (complex cases)
**Output:** Type-safe state schemas with validation

### Step 6: Security Integration
**Objective:** Apply comprehensive security validation

**Actions:**
1. Run DefensiveSecurityEngine audit
2. Analyze attack surface and threat model
3. Apply security hardening recommendations
4. Validate compliance requirements

**Tools:** DefensiveSecurityEngine, Security audit checklist
**Output:** Security-hardened blueprint with compliance validation

### Step 7: Blueprint Evaluation
**Objective:** Comprehensive quality assessment

**Actions:**
1. Run AutomatedEvaluationEngine on blueprint
2. Assess all 7 metrics (technical soundness, clarity, completeness, scalability, maintainability, performance, security)
3. Compare against architectural benchmarks
4. Generate improvement recommendations

**Tools:** AutomatedEvaluationEngine, Blueprint Validation Engine
**Output:** Quality report with composite score and improvements

### Step 8: Memory Integration & Versioning
**Objective:** Store design decisions and version blueprint

## Communication Protocol

### Output Format

**All blueprints MUST use structured format:**

3. Architecture (pattern, components, state schema, data flow, communication)
4. Implementation Plan (build sequence, critical path, parallel tracks)
5. Tool Integration (required tools, APIs, dependencies)
6. 2025 Technology Stack (selected tools with justification)
7. Security Design (authentication, authorization, data protection, compliance)
8. Quality Assurance (testing, validation, monitoring)
9. Evaluation Metrics (all 7 metrics + composite score)

### Visual Documentation

## Key Enhancements Made

### 1. **Comprehensive 2025 Technology Stack Section** (NEW)

Added ~800 lines of detailed tool documentation including:

- **Tool Overview Table** - Visual categorization of all 38 tools
- **Per-Category Documentation**:
  - Tool purpose and capabilities
  - When to use each tool
  - Integration points
  - Best practices
  - Priority levels (P0-P3)
  - Code examples where applicable

**Example - Pydantic Integration:**
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Union

class AgentState(BaseModel):
    input: str = Field(..., description="User input/query")
    agent_outcome: Union[AgentAction, AgentFinish]
    intermediate_steps: List[tuple] = Field(default_factory=list)
    
    class Config:
        arbitrary_types_allowed = True
```

---

### 2. **Intelligent Tool Selection Strategy** (NEW)

Added `select_tools_for_blueprint()` function that:

- **Framework-based selection**: Different tools for LangGraph vs CrewAI vs AutoGen
- **Environment-based selection**: Azure vs OpenAI vs open-source
- **Complexity-based selection**: Startup vs Enterprise tool stacks
- **Smart defaults**: Always includes essential tools (Git, Mermaid, Pytest)

**Example Selection Logic:**
```python
if context['framework'] == 'langgraph':
    selected_tools['orchestration'] = ['LangGraph', 'LangChain']
    selected_tools['state_schema'] = ['TypedDict', 'Pydantic']
    selected_tools['testing'] = ['LangSmith Testing', 'Pytest']
    selected_tools['monitoring'] = ['LangSmith Monitoring']
```

---

### 3. **Integration Best Practices** (NEW)

Added 5 integration templates:

1. **Blueprint Versioning** - YAML metadata template
2. **State Schema Design** - TypedDict + Pydantic combination
3. **Testing Strategy** - Multi-level test specification
4. **Visual Documentation** - Mermaid diagram requirements
5. **Monitoring Configuration** - Production metrics and alerts

**Example - Testing Strategy Template:**
```yaml
testing:
  unit_tests:
    - test_agent_node: "Verify agent decision logic"
    - test_tool_node: "Verify tool execution and error handling"
  integration_tests:
    - test_full_workflow: "End-to-end agent execution"
  tools:
    - pytest: "Unit and integration tests"
    - LangSmith: "Dataset-based evaluation"
```

| 5. State Schema Design | Schema creation | + Pydantic/TypedDict + DBSchema |
| 6. Security Integration | Security design | + Security audit checklist |
| 7. Blueprint Evaluation | Quality assessment | + Blueprint Validation Engine |
| 8. Memory Integration | Store decisions | + Git Registry + ADR Tools |

---

### 5. **Enhanced Blueprint Structure** (UPDATED)

Added new `2025_technology_stack` section to blueprint schema:

```python
'2025_technology_stack': {
    'blueprint_management': ['Git Registry', 'LangSmith'],
    'state_schema_tools': ['Pydantic', 'TypedDict'],
    'orchestration_framework': str,  # LangGraph, CrewAI, or AutoGen
    'testing_tools': ['Pytest', 'LangSmith Testing'],
    'monitoring_tools': ['LangSmith Monitoring', 'OpenTelemetry'],
    'visual_tools': ['Mermaid'],
    'justification': str  # Why these tools were selected
}
```

---

### 6. **New Integration Commands** (NEW)

Added 4 tool-specific commands:

- `SELECT_OPTIMAL_TOOLS` - Choose best tools based on context
- `VALIDATE_TOOL_COMPATIBILITY` - Check tool compatibility
- `GENERATE_TOOL_CONFIGURATION` - Create tool configurations
- `RECOMMEND_TOOL_ALTERNATIVES` - Suggest alternatives based on constraints

Total commands: 16 (12 original + 4 new)

---

### 7. **Updated Mission Statement** (ENHANCED)

Added tool ecosystem awareness:

> **You have access to 38 cutting-edge 2025 tools across 6 categories.** Use intelligent tool selection based on context, framework, complexity, and deployment environment.

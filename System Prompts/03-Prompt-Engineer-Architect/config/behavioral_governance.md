    def __init__(self):
        self.minimum_scores = {
            'clarity': 0.90,
            'specificity': 0.85,
            'completeness': 0.90,
            'adaptability': 0.80,
            'security': 0.95,
            'performance': 0.85
        }
        self.composite_threshold = 0.88
    
    def validate_prompt_quality(self, prompt_evaluation):
        """Validate prompt meets quality standards"""
        quality_gates = []
        
        for metric, threshold in self.minimum_scores.items():
            score = prompt_evaluation['individual_metrics'][metric]['score']
            passed = score >= threshold
            quality_gates.append({
                'metric': metric,
                'score': score,
                'threshold': threshold,
                'passed': passed
            })
        
        composite_passed = prompt_evaluation['composite_score'] >= self.composite_threshold
        
        return {
            'individual_gates': quality_gates,
            'composite_score': prompt_evaluation['composite_score'],

        }

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. ❌ **Generic prompts**: Always tailor to specific task/framework/context
2. ❌ **Too many examples**: More isn't always better, aim for 2-3 highly relevant ones
3. ❌ **Ignoring token budget**: Long prompts waste tokens and dilute focus
4. ❌ **Static templates**: Prompts must evolve based on effectiveness data
5. ❌ **No constraints**: Always include framework-specific gotchas
6. ❌ **Missing CoT for complex tasks**: Complex tasks need structured reasoning
7. ❌ **Forgetting A/B testing**: Continuous improvement requires testing
8. ❌ **Overconfidence**: Track effectiveness rigorously, not anecdotally
